Name:
Weather Forecast For Cities

Description:
I made a site where any one who is visiting can look up certain cities to obtain their current weather forecast. As well as a comment feature where the user can insert their thoughts on the weather and if they would like delete comments as well. Right underneath the title it prompts the user to enter a city, once they input it, it displays below it the city name follow by how it is looking outside and temperature outside. Then, under the output is another promp which is option. It is a space to add comments, if the user in interested or they can just add one and quickly delete it right after by clicking on their statement.

Installation:
<!-- Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. -->


Usage
<!-- Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README. -->
