Name:
Weather Forecast For Cities

Description:
I made a site where any one who is visits it, can look up certain cities to obtain their current weather forecast. As well as a comment feature where the user can insert their thoughts on the weather and if they would like, they can delete comments as well. Right underneath the title it prompts the user to enter a city, once they input it, it displays below it the city name followed by how it is looking outside and the temperature. Then, under the output is another prompt which is optional. It is a space to add comments, if the user is interested, they can just add any amount of comments and have the ability to delete them right after by clicking on their statement(s). The user can also change the background image by simply reloading the page, but beware once they page reloads the past image will not return unless it is reloaded multiple times to get back to.
